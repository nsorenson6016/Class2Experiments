        <h1>Neal's little fan page of The Tick!</h1>
        <p>

            The Tick was originally created in 1986 by an 18-year old cartoonist
            named Ben Englund.  He was first used as a newsletter mascot for a 
            chain of comic book stores in Boston, MA.  In 1988, he became the 
            lead character of his very own comic book series.  Six years later,
            he became an animated series on Fox.  During his three-season run, 
            he developed a cult-like following. He even became #57 of IGN's list
            of <a href="http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/57">The Top 100 
                Comic Book Characters of All Time</a> (Beast of the X-Men was 
                #58 and Hawkman was #56).  In 2001, The Tick became a live
                television series, starring Patrick Warburton as the big, blue
                superhero.  Although the cast and crew liked it, the series only
                lasted nine episodes.  The Tick's animated series got syndicated
                and was shown on Toon Disney and ABC Family.  The first season
                was released on DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 2006.
                One year later, the second season was released.
